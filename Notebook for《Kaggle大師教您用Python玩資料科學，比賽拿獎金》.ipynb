You're in the right place.\n","\n","This is the legendary Titanic ML competition‚Äîthe best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.\n","\n","The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\n","\n","Read on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you're ready to start competing, click on the¬†[\"Join Competition\" button](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)¬†to create an account and gain access to the¬†[competition data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

Unfortunately, there weren't enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n","\n","While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n","\n","In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: \"what sorts of people were more likely to survive?\" using passenger data (i.e., name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).\n","\n","> **Recommended Tutorial**\n","> \n","> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook's Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial/notebook) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step.\n","\n","### Overview of How Kaggle's Competitions Work\n","\n","**1.

It's your job to predict these outcomes.\n","\n","Using the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n","\n","Check out the¬†[\"Data\" tab](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)¬†to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you've created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n","\n","### How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\n","\n","Once you're ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n","\n","1.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.\n","\n","Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle's platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.\n","\n","### How do I create and manage a team?\n","\n","When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More >¬†[Team](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team)¬†page.\n","\n","We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the¬†[discussion forum](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion).\n","\n","### What are Notebooks?\n","\n","Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the¬†[Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks)¬†tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our¬†[Courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn)!\n","\n","### Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?\n","\n","To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two-month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.\n","\n","If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.\n","\n","\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"¬†Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard¬†[here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240).\n","\n","### How do I contact Support?\n","\n","Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you'll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you'll want to use the¬†[Titanic discussion forum](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion).\n","\n","Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can't find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n","\n","If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please¬†[contact
